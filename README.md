# IndexedDB Notes

This is a simple note-taking application that allows users to create and manage notes. The application leverages **IndexedDB** for local storage. If your browser supports IndexedDB, it will automatically store your notes locally. Otherwise, you will be notified with a warning.

## Features

- **Delete Notes** - Remove notes from the list.
- **Optimistic UI Updates** - Updates are shown immediately while interacting with the application for a seamless user experience.
- **IndexedDB Storage** - Notes are saved locally in the browser, so they persist even when the page is refreshed (if supported by the browser).
